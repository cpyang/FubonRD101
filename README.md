# FubonRD101
For Fubon new comer to know

## Pemrissions
- In Fubon bank, we need to apply EVERYTHING. I just try list down all items
> apply IPs in Nei-Hu and Ren'ai Rd

> also bind Mac address of laptop and IPs

> allow mailbox to receive email from non-Fubon sender. and send emails to non-Fubon recipients.

> allow mobile devices to receive email/calendar

> install 64-bit windows on laptop instead of default 32-bit windows. some applications only have 64 bit version.

> allow to install any applications on laptop

> allow to modify IPs on ethernet card

> make sure wireless card is allowed to access access point. btw, there is NO access point in Fubon officially. This is only for us to connect access point when we leave office.
